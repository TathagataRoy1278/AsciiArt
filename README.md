# AsciiArt
Converts still pictures and videos to ascii art

*** High contrast pictures work better***

requirements : opencv (cv2)

opencv can be downloaded using : 
```pip install opencv-python```

Save the image you want to convert in ```test.jpg``` and run 

```python asciiart.py``` 

and the output will be displayed in the terminal. The farther your eyes are from the screen
the better it will look.
